## Raketech test API

Backend (Laravel)
The backend should fetch the country names and flag images (only URLs, no need to
store files) from this API https://restcountries.com/ and serve them properly from the
respective controller, ideally while using common PHP/Laravel design patterns. Keep
in mind that since itâ€™s based on an external API, the implementation should be made
in such a way that the API could easily be replaced if needed. Though there is no need
for local storage (database or otherwise), bonus points will be awarded for the
implementation of the caching mechanism of your choice.

The project was created using laravel sail. Sail is the docker-compose.yml file and the sail script that is stored at the root of the project.
The sail script provides a CLI with convenient methods for interacting with the Docker containers defined by the docker-compose.yml file.
